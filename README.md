# Whole_number_converter
This is a program that converts any whole number from base 2,8,10 and 16 to any of the same bases. 

Convertions of Binary and octal to/from decimal or hexadecimal are more or less the same. Thus are combined in one function.
While converting between these two, I used a temp variable to convert it into decimal and then to the required base.
